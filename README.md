c.
    i. The purpose of this website is to provide potential employers with information about my past work, as well as my resume and other information about myself.
    ii. This website conveys information about my interests, how I spent my time at CMU, and past work experience.
    iii. The website is interesting and engaging thanks to its color choices, use of animations, and advanced scrolling carousel!
    iv. The target audience for the website is recruiters from other companies.

d.
    - Get my resume by clicking the resume button on the homepage
    - Check out my portfolio by clicking the portfolio button on my homepage, then move your mouse horizontally to find a project that looks interesting to you
    - Use the next project links to scroll through my projects
    - Use the get in touch button to send me an email

e.
    i. jQuery
    ii. I chose to use jQuery because it offered flexible options for making the carousel found on my website. That carousel is based off of this one, but modified heavily to fit my needs. https://codepen.io/web-tiki/pen/oygXeN 
    iii. I used jQuery to implement the carousel found on my website.
    iv. It allowed me to cleanly implement the carousel in fewer lines of more readable code than had I used raw javascript

    i. Bootstrap
    ii. I chose to use bootstrap to make it easier to implement the overall layout of my website. It helped to make organization a snap.
    iii. I used bootstrap to organize the layouts of my website. The row and column functionality was particularly helpful for this.
    iv. Using bootstrap allowed me to quickly put together the layout for the website. It saved me time that I would have wasted trying to create the layout myself in CSS.

f. I removed the button from the bottom of the main screen from homework 7. I thought that button was  redundant, because there is already a button to check out my work right under the blurb about myself.

g. Getting the carousel to behave how I wanted was a major challenge. I have not done very much javascript programming before, and I found it to be very difficult to grasp.
